# </> PlainCode

**Understand any code in seconds — and prove you understand your own.** PlainCode explains any code snippet in plain English, and challenges you to defend your own codebase under adversarial questioning. Powered by a 3-layer AI accuracy pipeline.

Free. No sign-up required.

## What It Does

PlainCode has three modes:

| Mode | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Explain** | Paste code, pick your audience, get a structured plain-English explanation |
| **Diff** | Compare two versions of code and understand what changed and why |
| **Defend** | Point at a GitHub repo — get grilled with 5 adversarial questions, scored 0–100 per answer |

---

## Features

### Defend Mode *(new)*

Point PlainCode at any public GitHub repository and defend your design decisions under pressure.

**How it works:**
1. Paste a public GitHub repo URL (e.g. `https://github.com/you/your-project`)
2. PlainCode fetches the codebase (up to 30,000 characters of source code)
3. A 3-layer AI pipeline generates **5 adversarial questions** — one per category:
   - **Architecture** — Why did you structure it this way?
   - **Edge Cases** — What happens when X breaks?
   - **Security** — What attack vectors did you leave open?
   - **Scalability** — What falls apart at 10× load?
   - **Alternatives** — Why this approach over the obvious alternative?
4. Answer each question in your own words
5. Claude scores every answer **0–100** with one line of sharp feedback
6. After all 5, get your **Defense Score** (average) and a **3-bullet summary of your weakest spots**

Questions are grounded in your actual code — file names, function names, patterns — not generic prompts. No auth, no storage. Fully stateless.

### Explain Mode

Paste code (or upload a file), pick your audience level, and get a structured explanation with:

- **Summary** — What the code does at a glance
- **Breakdown** — Step-by-step walkthrough of key parts
- **Analogy** — A real-world comparison to make it click
- **Data Map** — What goes in, what comes out, what transforms
- **Flow Diagram** — Auto-generated Mermaid.js flowchart of the logic
- **Confidence Score** — A 0–100 accuracy rating from a 3-layer AI check

#### 5 Audience Levels

| Level | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| **ELI5** | Anyone — uses everyday analogies, zero jargon |
| **Non-Technical** | Non-programmers — plain English, real-world comparisons |
| **Business** | PMs & executives — focuses on user impact and business value |
| **Tech Non-Dev** | Data analysts, sysadmins, tech writers — technical vocab, no code syntax |
| **Developer** | Fellow engineers — design patterns, edge cases, complexity analysis |

Changing the audience level automatically re-explains the same code.

---

### Diff Mode

Compare two versions of code side-by-side and get an explanation of **what changed and why it matters**. Perfect for reviewing pull requests.

- Paste "Before" and "After" code
- Get the same structured explanation, focused on the differences
- Supports up to 25,000 characters per side

---

### Follow-Up Q&A

After an explanation is generated, ask follow-up questions in a built-in chat:

- Full context of your code and explanation is preserved
- Conversation history maintained (last 6 exchanges)
- Streamed responses in real-time

---

### 15 Output Languages

Get explanations in: English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean, Italian, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, Dutch, Turkish, or Polish.

---

### Privacy Mode

Toggle privacy mode on the explain page to ensure your code is never stored or used for model training. Adds Anthropic's `no-training` header to all API calls.

---

### File Upload

Upload code files directly instead of pasting:

- Drag & drop onto the editor, or click to pick a file
- Supports 16+ extensions: `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.java`, `.rs`, `.go`, `.sql`, `.sh`, `.rb`, `.php`, `.cs`, `.cpp`, `.c`, `.json`, `.md`, `.txt`, and more

---

### Dark Mode

Full light and dark theme support with system detection. Toggle via the moon/sun icon in the navbar.

---

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Cmd+Enter** (Mac) / **Ctrl+Enter** (Windows/Linux) — Trigger explanation or diff
- **Enter** in Q&A — Send message

## How the 3-Layer AI Pipeline Works

Every feature in PlainCode runs through a 3-layer pipeline to ensure accuracy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 1: Intent Analysis (Claude Haiku)    │
│  → Detects language, purpose, complexity    │
│  → Grounds the explanation / questions      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 2: Generation (Claude Sonnet)        │
│  → Explains code / generates questions      │
│  → Streams in real-time via SSE             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 3: Adversarial Validation (Haiku)    │
│  → Checks output against the source         │
│  → Identifies and auto-corrects errors      │
│  → Adjusts confidence score                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

In Explain mode, Layer 3 validates the explanation and triggers an automatic revision loop if errors are found. In Defend mode, Layer 3 validates that the generated questions are specific to your codebase — not generic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22.12.0
- An Anthropic API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- *(Optional)* A GitHub personal access token — raises rate limits for Defend Mode

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/PlainCode.git
cd PlainCode

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```env
# Required — get yours at console.anthropic.com
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Optional — increases GitHub API rate limit for Defend Mode
# A read-only personal access token is sufficient
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
```

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The app uses Next.js standalone output mode for containerized deployments (Railway, Docker, etc.).
